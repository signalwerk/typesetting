## CNC
If you produce your own wood type. It's best to take pear wood («Stirnholz») [^pear].
I also saw good examples made with «Filmbeschichtete Birkensperrholzplatte» (Formica/Resopal) [^P98a]


[^pear]: I saw 2017 examplex made by Marko in Ljubljana. Awesome!
[^P98a]: I saw 2016 examplex made by [P98a](https://www.p98a.com/) in Berlin.
